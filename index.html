        <p>Automatic Crop Irrigation  system  is the artificial application of a controlled amount of water to the soil through pumps, and sprinkler [1]. Irrigation is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, re-vegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall, suppressing weed growth.  A crop is defined as any terrestrial plant grown for economic profit or personal use. Within many regions in  Nigeria  however, insufficient precipitation during the critical portions of the growing season (November 1 to January 31) may decrease productivity.</p>

      <p>The old method used for irrigation was  use of watering cans, water channels that have to be opened and closed manually or backpack sprinklers. In this case, a lot of water is wasted in the process.  There is need for improvement on the existing or old forms of irrigation. An automatic crop irrigation  system needs to be developed to optimize water use for agricultural crops.   Automatic crop irrigation system has to have all the components that will monitor and control the level of  water available to the plants without human intervention With the help of this technique, farmers will also face less issues or problems regarding to farming or having good yield in their farms produce. This new technology will  make agriculture great and help as they deliver efficiency and accuracy. </p>

        <p>This project  report  comprises of five  chapters. Chapter 1 (Introduction of the project) It gives a comprehensive detail about the project, introduction to the Automatic Crop Irrigation system with  digital  displays. the background,  aim and objectives, expected  benefit of project, significance, statement  of the  problem, scope of the work, limitation of the  project and structure of the project. Chapter 2  Literature Review A detailed literature review on an Automatic  Crop  Irrigation  system itself and related areas. A fundamental knowledge was obtained by the author on technologies and components which are utilised by the system later and how these constituents interface with one another. This chapter will outline the functions of the system and different sensor technologies including GSM module. This section of the report is basically the most important part of the report as itâ€™s based on the key aspect of the system. </p>
